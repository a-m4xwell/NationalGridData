    <div class="heading">What</div>
    <p>!!INSERT NAME HERE!! is a tool for those interested in where our electricity comes from and what impact it is
        having on
        our planet. It was designed to give a quick and clear indication on how much carbon dioxide is being produced in
        real
        time. The carbon generated by electrical production and consumption will never be zero, however we can reduce
        it by making informed decisions about when and how we consume electricity.</p>

    <div class="heading">Why</div>
    <p>I created this site as a side project to learn more about utilising API's, but the greatest impact this project
        has had
        on me was learning how to take raw data and turn it into a simple and easy to understand visualization. This
        meant
        having to learn more about how to display data in a way that tells a story. That became the intention for this
        site,
        take raw data and giving it meaning.</p>

    <div class="heading">How</div>
    <p>The data for this sight is gathered from the <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/">Carbon Intensity</a> API
        which is free for everyone and has a generous request limit. The charts are generated using the D3 JavaScript
        library.
        The generation mix pie chart currently a plugin from <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">high charts</a>,
        however
        I will be replacing it eventually with a chart of my own making.</p>
